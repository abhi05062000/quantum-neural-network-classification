# Quantum Neural Network for Binary Classification

This project demonstrates the use of **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** to solve a simple **binary classification problem**. The main objective is to explore how **quantum computing** can influence machine learning models and to showcase how quantum circuits can be used for classification tasks.

## ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**

The project utilizes **PennyLane** (a quantum machine learning library) to create a quantum neural network model that learns from input data and classifies it into two categories (binary classification). The dataset used is a simple **synthetic dataset** with two features.

### Key Insights:
1. Quantum circuits are used to encode data into qubit states.
2. A hybrid quantum-classical approach is used for training.
3. The goal is to understand the potential **quantum influence** on AI.

## ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**
- **PennyLane**: A library for quantum machine learning.
- **PyTorch**: For classical optimization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For dataset generation and data splitting.
- **Python 3.x**
